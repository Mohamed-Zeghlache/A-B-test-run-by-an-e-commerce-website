# A/B-test-run-by-an-e-commerce-website
the goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment 
longer to make their decision.

## Steps and tools used :
i have used probabilty to see if there is sufficient evidence that the new treatment page leads to more conversions,

next, i have set up hypethesis for testing to have a more precise decision

and then, i have performed a logistic regression on the data

## Conclusion
after all this analysis, i found that there is not enogh evidence that the country significatly influences the conversion rate. therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis because all of our analysis prooved that the old page is better than or similar to the new page. so, we shouldn't launch the new page.
